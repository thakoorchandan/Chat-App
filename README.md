# React and Firebase Chat App

This is the project code for my [React and Firebase](https://chat-app-xi-bay.vercel.app/). The app uses React for the frontend, Firestore for real-time messaging, and Firebase Authentication for Email and Password.

Some specific React concepts this tutorial teaches are:

* Storing global context with the Context API
* Creating custom hooks for consuming context and synchronizing with external data
* Using unauthenticated and authenticated app components based on the user's authentication state

## Quick start

1. Add your Firebase configuration to `src/firebase.jsx`
2. Run `npm install && npm run start`
